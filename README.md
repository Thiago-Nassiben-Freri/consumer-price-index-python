# Consumer Price Index Calculator in Python

The Consumer Price Index is used to observe inflation trends. It is calculated based on the average price needed to purchase a set of consumer goods and services in a country, compared to previous periods.

In this project, I used the Python requests library to retrieve data to be used to calculate the CPI. So you can enter the desired value and year of that value to find out how much it would currently be worth.
